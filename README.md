MapleSimplicity
===============
As you all know, there have been many versions of this website released. I believe this is the cleanest and most modern version, because it uses HTML5/CSS3 (using bootstrap as a base for gridding and basic reset/typography styling). It also uses MySQLi, the new standard for the web. Please use this as an example of a "modern" maplestory website. Note that the registration script is from CypeReboot, and the vote script is by Cinos11, and then modified to work with mysqli.
Unzipped, the website takes up a little under 500kb, making it the smallest maplestory website I have written (I think!). I had coded this several months ago, but I updated the code this morning.

You will have to fill in the rankings page, and download images yourself. I have not added a control panel, but I may add it in at a later date. If you find any bugs, let me know. Post your comments, questions, etc. below!

(Thanks to Evolized for designing the website).
