MapleSimplicity
===============
As you all know, there have been many versions of this website released. I believe this is the cleanest and most modern version, because it uses HTML5/CSS3 (using bootstrap as a base for gridding and basic reset/typography styling). It also uses MySQLi, the new standard for the web. Please use this as an example of a "modern" maplestory website. Note that the registration script is from [MapleBit](https://github.com/greenelfx/MapleBit), and the vote script was written by Cinos11, and then modified to work with MySQLi.
Unzipped, the website takes up a little under 500kb, making it the smallest maplestory website I have written (I think!).

The website contains features you'd find in any normal Maple CMS. It has all the basic pages, except for a rankings script and download images. A functional User Control Panel written from scratch has been implemented. If you find any bugs, let me know. Post your comments, questions, etc. below!
